## Description

> One day, you'll find what's hidden. Today might be that day.

A steganography challenge with a PNG image. The title and description hint at patience and careful observation — something is hidden, and it's up to you to find it.

---

## Approach

### Step 1 — Visual Inspection

The image was opened and examined visually. Nothing unusual was apparent in the image content itself — no obvious text, QR codes, or visual artifacts.

### Step 2 — File Type Confirmation

```bash
$ file image.png
image.png: PNG image data, [dimensions], 8-bit/color RGBA, non-interlaced
```

Confirmed it's a legitimate PNG, not a renamed archive or other format.

### Step 3 — Metadata Extraction with exiftool

The first tool to reach for in any image steganography challenge:

```bash
$ exiftool image.png
```

**Key output fields to examine:**
- `Comment` — frequently used to hide flags
- `Artist` / `Author`
- `Description` / `ImageDescription`
- `Copyright`
- `UserComment`
- `XMP` fields

The flag was found directly in the **metadata comment field**:

```
Comment: 0dayheist{1_dAy_U_will_Be}
```

### Step 4 — Verify with strings

Cross-verified with:

```bash
$ strings image.png | grep -i "heist\|day\|ctf\|flag\|0day"
```

The same flag string appeared in the output.

## Full Recon Checklist (for completeness)

Even though the flag was found at Step 3, here's the full methodology for image steganography challenges:

```bash
# 1. Identify file
file image.png

# 2. Metadata
exiftool image.png

# 3. Printable strings
strings image.png

# 4. Embedded files / archives
binwalk image.png
binwalk -e image.png   # extract if found

# 5. LSB steganography (PNG)
zsteg image.png
zsteg -a image.png     # all bit planes

# 6. Steghide (JPEG primarily, but worth trying)
steghide extract -sf image.png

# 7. Spectrogram analysis (if audio is embedded or if visual patterns)
# Open in Audacity or SonicVisualiser

# 8. Colour plane analysis
stegsolve image.png    # GUI tool — cycle through bit planes
```

## Tools Used

- `exiftool` — metadata extraction
- `strings` — printable string scan
- `file` — file type identification

## What I Learned

The golden rule of steganography challenges: **always check metadata before doing anything complex**. EXIF data is the fastest, lowest-effort hiding spot for challenge authors — and the first thing solvers should examine.

**Methodology priority order:**
1. `exiftool` (metadata)
2. `strings` (printable data)
3. `binwalk` (embedded files)
4. `zsteg` / `stegsolve` (LSB)
5. Spectrogram / colour analysis
